    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **c) Word Replacement:** Create a function `replace_keyword_in_report(report_text, old_keyword, new_keyword)` that takes a string (report text) and two keywords, then `return`s a new string where all occurrences of `old_keyword` are replaced by `new_keyword`.\n",

    "**2. Light-weight: Converters & Checks**\n",

    "- **c) Average Calculation:** Create a function `calculate_average_signal(signal_strengths_list)` that takes a list of numbers (integers or floats) and `return`s their average.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **b) Keyword Scanner:** Create a function `scan_logs_for_keywords(log_entries_list)` that accepts a list of strings (log entries). The function should iterate through the list and **print** a warning message along with the log entry if any log entry contains sensitive keywords like `\"classified\"`, `\"protocol_xyz\"`, or `\"access_code\"`.

Each nested function should simply `print` a message indicating the direction of travel (e.g., \"Explorer is moving North.\"). The `navigation_hub` function should ask the user (via `input`) which direction they want to go (e.g., by entering \"N\", \"S\", \"E\", \"W\"). Based on the input, the `navigation_hub` function should then **call** the corresponding nested navigation function. If the input is invalid, it should print an error message. (The `navigation_hub` function itself might not explicitly `return` anything for this part).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **b) Challenge - Continuous Navigation:** Using a `while` loop, allow the explorer (user) to repeatedly choose a direction from the `navigation_hub` concept. The loop should continue asking for a direction and executing the corresponding navigation (calling the appropriate simple print function like `Maps_north()`) until the user chooses an \"Exit\" option (e.g., enters \"Q\" for Quit). Handle invalid choices within the loop by printing an error message and re-displaying options or re-prompting."
