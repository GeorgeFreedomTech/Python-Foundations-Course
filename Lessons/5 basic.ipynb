    "# 5. Navigating Repetitive Tasks: Cycles & Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we often need to repeat a block of code multiple times. This process is called iteration, and the structures that control it are known as cycles or loops. They are essential tools for automating repetitive actions, processing collections of data, or running simulations until a certain condition is met â€“ much like an explorer repeatedly taking readings in an area or following a set of procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will guide you through:\n",
    "- The `while` loop: Repeating based on a condition.\n",
    "- The `for` loop: Iterating over sequences.\n",
    "- The `range()` function: Generating sequences of numbers.\n",
    "- Nested loops: Loops within other loops for complex patterns.\n",
    "- Loop control statements: `break`, `continue`, and the `else` clause in loops.\n",
    "- Core concepts: Iteration, iterating, and iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1. The `while` Loop: Repeating As Long As a Condition Holds\n",
    "- The `while` loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition evaluates to `True`.\n",
    "- It's ideal for situations where the exact number of repetitions isn't known before the loop starts,\n",
    "- for example, continuing an operation until a user signals to stop, or a sensor reading reaches a threshold.\n"

    "    - Iterate through the *values* of the `anomaly_report_data` dictionary and print the data type of each value using `type()`.\n",
    "    - Store all the *keys* from the `anomaly_report_data` dictionary into a list. Print this list of keys.\n",
    "    - Convert this list of keys into a set. Then, check if the number of elements in the list of keys is the same as the number of elements in the set of keys (it should be, as dictionary keys are inherently unique). Print a message indicating whether the counts are the same, along with both counts."
