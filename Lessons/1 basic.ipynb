    "# 1. Variables & Core Functions: (Expedition Basics)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every successful exploration or data-gathering mission begins with mastering the fundamental tools. In Python, this foundational toolkit includes variables for storing crucial pieces of information (like discovered coordinates, artifact IDs, or sensor readings) and core functions that allow basic interactions, data input, and the display of findings. This first lesson establishes these essential building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key topics we will navigate:\n",
    "- Variables and the values they hold (your data containers)\n",
    "- Adding single-line and multi-line comments to your code (annotating your logs and procedures)\n",
    "- The `print()` function (for displaying results and status messages)\n",
    "- The `input()` function (for receiving directives or data from the operative/user)\n",
    "- `f-string` formatting (for creating clear and readable textual outputs)\n",
    "- Type casting / parsing (converting data from one format to another, e.g., a string signal to a numerical value)\n",
    "- The `type()` function (to identify the nature of your data)\n",
    "- The `id()` function (to understand the unique identity of data objects in memory)"
