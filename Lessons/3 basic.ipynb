    "# 3. Controlling the Flow: Conditions and Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like navigating a path with forks and decisions based on your map or sensor readings, programming requires ways to control the flow of execution based on specific conditions. Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, along with logical and comparison operators, to make these critical decisions during our program's 'journey'.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will cover:\n",
    "- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else` – Choosing the path.\n",
    "- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` – Evaluating the terrain.\n",
    "- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not` – Combining checks and conditions.\n",
    "- Membership checking: `in`, `not in` – Verifying tools or locations.\n",
    "- Ternary operator – A shortcut for simple decisions.\n",
    "- `match-case` statement (Python 3.10+) – Handling specific signals or findings."

    "    - You are monitoring incoming text messages for potential alerts.\n",

    "        - if `age` is greater than 18 **and** less than 25, print: `\"Access Granted (Level 2 Clearance).\"`\n",
