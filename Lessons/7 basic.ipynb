    "Python's power is greatly enhanced by its extensive collection of modules, libraries, and packages. These are pre-written pieces of code that provide additional functionality, like specialized tools, maps, or communication devices for different phases of an exploration.\n",

    "- Importing and installing modules (`import`, `pip install` concept)\n",

    "Modules or libraries are essentially files containing Python code (functions, classes, variables)\n",
    "that you can bring into your project to extend its capabilities.\n",
    "Some modules are \"built-in\" (part of Python's standard library); others need to be installed first.\n",
    "If a module is available (built-in or installed), use the `import` statement to use its contents.\n",
    "For external modules not yet on your system, you typically install them using a command in your terminal/command prompt: `pip install <module_name>`, then import as usual."

    "## 7.4. Expedition Planning: Software Architecture Principles\n",
    "When building larger programs or planning complex \"expeditions,\" a well-thought-out structure is crucial.\n",
    "Three fundamental principles guide good software architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `Abstraction`: Hiding complex implementation details behind a simpler interface. Focus on *what* a component does, not *how* it achieves it. Like using a complex sensor with simple controls.\n",
    "2.  `Modularity`: Breaking down a large system into smaller, manageable, and ideally independent modules or components. Each module handles a specific aspect of the overall task.\n",
    "3.  `Reusability`: Designing components (like functions, classes, or entire modules) so they can be used in multiple parts of a program or even in different projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main goal is to divide a program into distinct, logical parts (`modularity`) that can then be potentially reused in other programs or contexts (`reusability`).\n",
    "- `Abstraction` is the ability to `use`, `create`, and `design` components that manage underlying complexity for us. For example, when you use `sum(my_list)`, you are using an abstraction for adding numbers without needing to know the exact algorithm Python uses.\n",
    "Your own custom functions also provide a level of abstraction for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "- Python itself is a language with a `high degree of abstraction` and strongly supports `object-oriented programming (OOP)`, allowing us to focus on our goals rather than low-level machine details.\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "- For significant projects, designing an architecture that embodies these principles from the start is important. Depending on the project's nature, established `design patterns` can help structure this architecture (e.g., MVC, Facade, Singleton, Factory – these are more advanced topics).\n",
    "- Most substantial applications are composed of several files (modules) that are imported into a main script (often named `main.py` or `app.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "- Functions are typically grouped into modules based on their purpose, use, or similarity:\n",
    "- One module might handle functions for acquiring mission parameters (e.g., target coordinates, operative details).\n",
    "- Another for calculations (e.g., trajectory analysis, resource consumption estimates, data processing).\n",
    "- Another for generating reports or logging results (to console, files, or a central database).\n",
    "- There's a good chance, for instance, that functions for validating input data or formatting reports will be needed across multiple projects, demonstrating the `reusability of your code`.\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "- These architectural principles are especially powerful and evident when combined with `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)`, which provides robust tools for creating modular, abstract, and reusable code structures."
