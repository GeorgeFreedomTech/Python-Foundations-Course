    "- Installation\n",
    "- Development Environments\n",
    "- Understanding Code\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.1. The Python Language & Installation\n",
    "- Python is a `dynamically typed` language with a high level of `abstraction` = it's easy to read, write, and use, ideal for quickly developing ideas.\n",
    "- Download the language from the official website: https://www.python.org/ (section `Downloads`), choose the version for your operating system.\n",
    "- Run the downloaded file and install it – completing the Python setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.2. Choosing Your Development Environment\n",
    "- Where will we write and run our code? We have several options:\n",
    "    - **1. Online Tools (No local installation required):**\n",
    "        - *Online Interpreter:* E.g., at https://www.online-python.com/, you can quickly try simple commands without installation.\n",
    "        - *Online Jupyter (JupyterLite):* At https://jupyter.org/try, you can try the interactive Jupyter environment directly in your browser, perfect for getting started.\n",
    "    - **2. Basic Options (Included with Python):**\n",
    "        - *`IDLE` (Integrated Development and Learning Environment):* A simple editor and console installed along with Python. Launch it as the \"IDLE\" application.\n",
    "        - *`REPL` (Interactive Console):* After installing Python, just open a terminal (command prompt) and type `python`. You can enter commands directly for quick tests.\n",
    "    - **3. Standalone IDEs (Integrated Development Environments):**\n",
    "        - *`Thonny`:* Great for beginners, simple, free, and includes its own Python, so you don't need a separate installation. https://thonny.org/\n",
    "        - *`Jupyter Notebook/Lab`:* An excellent tool for learning, data analysis, and smaller projects. It combines notes and code in one interactive document. Free. https://jupyter.org/ \n",
    "        - *`VS Code`:* A versatile and powerful IDE, free. With extensions for Python and Jupyter, it becomes a flexible tool for various types of projects. https://code.visualstudio.com/\n",
    "        - *`PyCharm`:* A top-tier IDE specialized for Python, ideal for large and complex projects. The Community Edition is free. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our base - Working with Files\n",
    "- Set up a dedicated folder for your projects and notes.\n",
    "- We'll save our interactive notes and code experiments:\n",
    "    - in Jupyter files (extension `.ipynb`)\n",
    "    - in Python files (extension `.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our workshop - IDE Recommendations\n",
    "- Many find `Jupyter` an excellent starting point for learning and experimenting, thanks to its combination of code and notes.\n",
    "- As your projects grow (you start working with multiple files, creating your own functions and modules), full-featured `IDEs` like `VS Code` or `PyCharm` might become more comfortable and offer more support tools for managing complex projects. `PyCharm` has particularly strong features for Object-Oriented Programming (building complex systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation (Pro Tip)\n",
    "- Start directly with `VS Code`. Install extensions (plugins) for `Python` a `Jupyter`. You get a versatile environment that adapts to your needs from the beginning through to advanced projects."

    "## 0.3. Our Workshop - The IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "Our universal `IDE` will be `VS Code` with extensions installed for `Python` and `Jupyter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Python**\n",
    "We can run our Python scripts & programs (`.py` files) directly in our IDE. Itš a perfect way how built our apps or larger programs. When we run our code it executes all the operations from top to bottom in the order we wrote them = top down. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We can write our notes and explanations in a form of comments directly into our \"code\" in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Jupyter**\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` files) is the ideal tool for experimenting with Python. It allows us to combine:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Live Code:** we can execute and test our code immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Formatted Text (Markdown):** for explaining concepts, our notes, and comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classic Python scripts (`.py` files), which run from top to bottom all at once, Jupyter works in **cells** and we can run our code \"independently\" in different places as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sum-Up ⚠️ Protocol: Code Chronology\n",
    "* In standard Python programming (`.py` file), code is executed `strictly from top to bottom`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Jupyter (`.ipynb` file), we have the freedom to run selected cells `independently and in any order`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Interpreter vs. Jupyter Kernel\n",
    "* The `interpreter` **executes** our Python code = for Python, we need a Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `kernel` **wraps** the selected interpreter (e.g., the Python one) and enables the specific way of executing code in a Jupyter Notebook (JPN)."
