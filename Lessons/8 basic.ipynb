    "# 8. Handling the Unexpected: Errors and Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "During any exploration or operation, unexpected issues can arise. In programming, these are broadly categorized as errors and exceptions. Knowing how to anticipate and manage them is crucial for building robust and reliable programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will cover:\n",
    "- Active vs. Passive error handling: `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`\n",
    "- Understanding Errors vs. Exceptions, using `raise` to signal issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.1. Strategies for Handling Errors\n",
    "There are two main approaches to dealing with potential problems in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Active Error Handling: This involves proactively checking for potential issues using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`). It's like checking your map and equipment before entering a new area to avoid predictable problems. Best for simple, clearly definable error conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Passive Error Handling: This uses the `try-except` block to \"catch\" errors (exceptions) when they occur during runtime. It's like having emergency protocols for unforeseen obstacles or equipment malfunctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, `try-except` is used for operations where success is not guaranteed or is outside your program's direct control, such as:\n",
    "- Reading input from a user (they might enter incorrect or malformed data – \"faulty sensor readings\").\n",
    "- Opening or reading from files (the file might not exist, or you might lack permissions – \"logbook inaccessible\").\n",
    "- Fetching data from web pages or APIs (the site might be down, connection might fail – \"comms link lost\")."

    "- **b) Specific ValueError Catch:** Prompt the user to enter a `sensor_value` (numeric). Use `try` for input and integer conversion. Specifically catch a `ValueError` and print a user-friendly message if they enter text instead of numbers.\n",
    "- **c) Custom Exception for Validation:** Prompt the user for an `operative_callsign`. The callsign should only contain letters. If the input contains numbers or other non-alphabetic characters, `raise` a custom `Exception` with an explanatory message. Catch this exception and print its message.\n",

    "- Using `try-except` blocks, ensure the following:\n",
    "    - `first_name` and `last_name`: Must be strings composed only of letters. Surrounding whitespace should be removed. If not, raise a `ValueError` with a specific message.\n",
    "    - `service_years`: Must be a string that represents a whole number (contains only digits). If not, raise a `ValueError`. (Note: For this part, just check if it's digits; actual conversion to `int` can be done later if needed).\n",
    "    - `assigned_city`: Must be one of the cities from a predefined list of `APPROVED_MISSION_CITIES` (e.g., `[\"Port Kepler\", \"Olympus Base\", \"Nova Station\", \"Unity Outpost\", \"Terra Prime\"]`). If not, raise a general `Exception` with a specific message.\n",

    "    - You can use string methods.\n",
