    "# 2. Working with Text: String Functions and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "As explorers of the digital world, we frequently encounter information as text (strings, `str`). Python provides powerful tools – functions and methods – to process and shape this textual data, much like refining raw data from sensors or preparing messages for transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions:** General tools applicable to various data types. They act *on* the data you provide: `print(message)`, `len(log_entry)`. Think of these as standard-issue gear available for many tasks across your toolkit.\n",
    "- **Methods:** Actions specific to a particular data type, like strings. They are *called on* the object using dot notation: `signal.strip()`, `report.title()`. These are like specialized attachments designed for your string 'equipment', allowing specific manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson covers key tools for string manipulation:\n",
    "- Getting string length with `len()`.\n",
    "- Changing text case (`.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.capitalize()`, `.title()`).\n",
    "- Cleaning up whitespace (`.strip()`) and formatting spacing (`.ljust()`, `.rjust()`, `.center()`).\n",
    "- Locating substrings (`.find()`).\n",
    "- Checking string properties (`.startswith()`, `.endswith()`, `.isalnum()`, etc.).\n",
    "- Modifying content (`.replace()`) and counting occurrences (`.count()`).\n",
    "- Different ways to define strings (quotes).\n",
    "- Structuring data with `split()` and `join()`."
