    "# 4. Data Containers: Collections & Their Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "As we explore programming and data, we need effective ways to store and organize multiple pieces of information efficiently. Python offers several versatile built-in collection types, each acting like a different kind of container suited for specific tasks â€“ like specialized inventory lists, keyed data logs, sets of unique discoveries, or fixed coordinate tuples in our explorer's toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll investigate these fundamental containers:\n",
    "- `list`: Ordered, changeable sequences (our primary mission log or equipment list).\n",
    "- `dictionary`: Key-value pairings (detailed artifact records or configuration settings).\n",
    "- `set`: Unordered collections of unique items (tracking unique samples or crew members).\n",
    "- `tuple`: Ordered, unchangeable sequences (fixed mission parameters or coordinates).\n",
    "- `frozenset`: Unchangeable sets (permanent reference data like allowed commands).\n",
    "- Checking data types (`type()`, `isinstance()`).\n",
    "- Comparing objects (`==` for value, `is` & `id()` for identity and `hash()` for hash value)."
