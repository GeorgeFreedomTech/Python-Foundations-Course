    "**Scenario:** You are developing a modular system to manage an expedition's artifact inventory.\n",

    "1.  **Project Setup:**\n",
    "    - Create a new folder named `expedition_inventory_system`. All files for this exercise go here.\n",

    "2.  **Data Module (`artifact_data.py`):**\n",
    "    - In `artifact_data.py`, create a list named `current_artifact_manifest`.\n",
    "    - Populate this list with a few initial artifact names (strings), e.g., `\"Ancient Compass\"`, `\"Encrypted Datapad\"`, `\"Energy Crystal\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Operations Module (`inventory_actions.py`):**\n",
    "    - In `inventory_actions.py`, define the following functions:\n",
    "        - `display_manifest(manifest_list)`: Takes a list as a parameter and prints all items in it, perhaps numbered for clarity (like your CZ solution using `enumerate`).\n",
    "        - `add_artifact_to_manifest(manifest_list, new_artifact_name)`: Takes the list and a new artifact name (string) as parameters. It should add the new artifact to the list and print a confirmation message. (This function will modify the list in-place and does not need to return it, mirroring the CZ solution style).\n",
    "        - `remove_artifact_from_manifest(manifest_list, artifact_to_remove)`: Takes the list and an artifact name (string) as parameters. It should remove the artifact from the list if it exists, printing a confirmation. If the artifact isn't found, it should print an appropriate message.

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Main Program Logic (`main_operations.py`):**\n",
    "    - In `main_operations.py`, import the `current_artifact_manifest` list from `artifact_data.py` and all necessary functions from `inventory_actions.py`.\n",
    "    - Create a main function, e.g., `manage_inventory_system()`. This function will contain the primary loop and logic:\n",
    "        - Display a menu to the user with the following options:\n",
    "            1.  Display current artifact manifest\n",
    "            2.  Add new artifact to manifest\n",
    "            3.  Remove artifact from manifest\n",
    "            4.  Shutdown inventory system (Quit)\n",
    "        - Based on the user's input choice, call the appropriate imported function or perform the action.\n",
    "        - The menu should be displayed repeatedly after each action (use a loop), until the user chooses to quit.\n",
    "        - Handle invalid menu choices gracefully.\n",
    "    - At the end of `main_operations.py`, call your `manage_inventory_system()` function to start the program."
