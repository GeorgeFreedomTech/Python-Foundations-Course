    "- **a) Generic Error Catch:** Prompt the user to enter a numerical `data_packet_id`. Use a `try` block for the input and conversion to an integer. Use a generic `except` block to print a general error message if any issue occurs (e.g., user enters text).\n",
    "- **b) Specific ValueError Catch:** Prompt the user to enter a `sensor_value` (numeric). Use `try` for input and integer conversion. Specifically catch a `ValueError` and print a user-friendly message if they enter text instead of numbers.\n",
    "- **c) Custom Exception for Validation:** Prompt the user for an `operative_callsign`. The callsign should only contain letters. If the input contains numbers or other non-alphabetic characters, `raise` a custom `Exception` with an explanatory message. Catch this exception and print its message.\n",

    "- You are verifying credentials for an operative about to embark on a mission. Request the following inputs: `first_name`, `last_name`, `service_years` (as a number), and `assigned_city`.\n",
    "- Using `try-except` blocks, ensure the following:\n",
    "    - `first_name` and `last_name`: Must be strings composed only of letters. Surrounding whitespace should be removed. If not, raise a `ValueError` with a specific message.\n",
    "    - `service_years`: Must be a string that represents a whole number (contains only digits). If not, raise a `ValueError`. (Note: For this part, just check if it's digits; actual conversion to `int` can be done later if needed).\n",
    "    - `assigned_city`: Must be one of the cities from a predefined list of `APPROVED_MISSION_CITIES` (e.g., `[\"Port Kepler\", \"Olympus Base\", \"Nova Station\", \"Unity Outpost\", \"Terra Prime\"]`). If not, raise a general `Exception` with a specific message.\n",
    "- *Recommendations:*\n",
    "    - You can use string methods.\n",
    "    - Consider separate `try-except` blocks for validating distinct pieces of information.\n",
    "    - Test your code by intentionally providing incorrect values to see what errors are raised and if your `except` blocks catch them correctly.\n",
